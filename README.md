### Node 3 Project by Mikaela Dorch

**Overview**
### This illustration/design tool is based on <em>Apple's</em> hard working and colorful <em>macOS</em> spinning wheel during processing times. The goal of this project is to allow user experimentation of RGB colors and design patterns with its adjustable slider functionality. The first slider adjusts hue range from pastels to saturated hues. In addition, the second slider adjusts the direction, blend, and design range of the various colors. Users can also clear and save their canvas art to their computers.
