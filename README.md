### Moonlight
## Learn the Lunar Phases
# Node 3 Project by Mikaela Dorch
---
**Overview**
This project is based on my ongoing journey and research of studying moon phases and spirituality. The goal from my research is inspired by a moon application I use that draws out key positions and events of Earthâ€™s moon. However, I want to expand on the spiritual meanings behind each phase of the moon and its effects on our lives.
